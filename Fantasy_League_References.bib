	abstract = {With the support of the blockchain systems, the cryptocurrency has changed the world of virtual assets. Digital games, especially those with massive multi-player scenarios, will be significantly impacted by this novel technology. However, there are insufficient academic studies on this topic. In this work, we filled the blank by surveying the state-of-the-art blockchain games. We discuss the blockchain integration for games and then categorize existing blockchain games from the aspects of their genres and technical platforms. Moreover, by analyzing the industrial trend with a statistical approach, we envision the future of blockchain games from technological and commercial perspectives.},

There is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, risk management, internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology in both technological and application perspectives. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology. In particular, this paper gives the blockchain taxonomy, introduces typical blockchain consensus algorithms, reviews blockchain applications and discusses technical challenges as well as recent advances in tackling the challenges. Moreover, this paper also points out the future directions in the blockchain technology.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has influenced the financial industry by creating a new crypto-economy. Then, next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted third-party have emerged thanks to the appearance of smart contracts, which are computer protocols designed to facilitate, verify, and enforce automatically the negotiation and agreement among multiple untrustworthy parties. Despite the bright side of smart contracts, several concerns continue to undermine their adoption, such as security threats, vulnerabilities, and legal issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of blockchain-enabled smart contracts from both technical and usage points of view. To do so, we present a taxonomy of existing blockchain-enabled smart contract solutions, categorize the included research papers, and discuss the existing smart contract-based studies. Based on the findings from the survey, we identify a set of challenges and open issues that need to be addressed in future studies. Finally, we identify future trends.},

The programmability of previously unrealized assets, such as money, and the automation of previously manual business logic are both made possible by smart contracts. This revelation inspired us to analyze smart contracts in blockchain technologies written in English between 2012 and 2022. The scope of research is limited to the journal. Reviews, conferences, book chapters, theses, monographs, and interview-based works, and also articles in the press, are eliminated. This review comprises 252 articles over the last ten years with “Blockchain”, “block-chain”, “smart contracts”, and “smart contracts” as keywords. This paper discusses smart contracts’ present status and significance in blockchain technology. The gaps and challenges in the relevant literature have also been discussed, particularly emphasizing the limitations. Based on these findings, several research problems and prospective research routes for future study that will likely be valuable to academics and professionals are identified.},

In particular, we start by exploring some of the advantages of these technologies, specifically the immutability of blockchains and automated contract remittance. We also discuss two critical shortcomings of decentralized smart contracts, namely regulatory uncertainty and a lack of confidential execution. With these issues in mind, we next explore how American legislators have begun to address smart contracts and blockchains. Though quite limited, there have been a few provisions clarifying the status of these technologies. We break down some of the language expressed in these bills so as to understand the current legal status of smart contracts and blockchains. Given this foundation, we consider the next steps that should be taken as smart contracts mature. This pertains to both the continued improvement of the underlying technology as well as the progress taken by regulators. Finally, assuming a futuristic scenario where there are no technological or regulatory barriers to smart contract adoption, we discuss how the process of contract remittance can be expedited in a world fully committed to the use of smart contracts.},

	abstract = {There has been a rise in the demand for blockchain-based smart contract development platforms and language implementations. On the other hand, smart contracts and blockchain applications are generated using non-standard software life cycles, which means that, for example, distributed applications are rarely updated, or bugs are fully addressed by releasing a newer version, leading to security flaws and challenges for users to adopt the technology. Smart contracts have gained significant attention due to their potential to automate and secure various transactions in diverse domains. However, the increasing adoption of smart contracts has also raised concerns about security vulnerabilities and potential risks. In this paper, an overview of smart contracts was discussed in detail. It further distinguished and compared smart contracts security with conventional security regarding security, privacy, communication channel, etc. Different platforms for smart contracts, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Counterparty, Stellar, Monax, and Lisk, are also discussed in this paper. Some proposed techniques are used in different areas for handling security threats in smart contracts. In addition, a taxonomy of the smart contracts security application was proposed, which attempts to solve some of the flaws and inadequacies in smart contracts. The study also provides a comprehensive smart contracts security scenario with different techniques. Lastly, the possible attacks posed by threats and vulnerabilities of the smart contracts are provided. The security threats and vulnerabilities addressed in this study are unique to smart contracts.},

We analyze how decentralization relates to consensus quality and how the quintessential features of blockchain remold the landscape of competition. Smart contracts can mitigate informational asymmetry and improve welfare and consumer surplus through enhanced entry and competition, yet distributing information during consensus generation may encourage greater collusion. In general, blockchains sustain market equilibria with a wider range of economic outcomes.

	abstract = {The gaming industry, which predominantly depends on centralized platforms, faces growing challenges in protecting digital assets, ensuring gameplay fairness, and addressing online fraud. Conventional gaming systems store player data on centralised servers, including sensitive financial and personal information, making them particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks and security breaches. With gaming transactions frequently occurring on unsecured mobile and desktop platforms, player accounts are often at risk of theft, hacking, and fraud. These security vulnerabilities result in significant financial losses for players and developers, underscoring the urgent need for a secure, transparent, decentralized solution. In light of these challenges, adopting blockchain technology in gaming platforms has emerged as a promising and transformative solution. Blockchain’s decentralized and immutable ledger offers enhanced security, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to manipulate transaction records or steal digital assets. Research and practical implementations have shown that blockchain can effectively reduce online fraud by securely storing in-game assets and transactions on decentralized networks, ensuring their integrity and resistance to tampering. This paper makes several significant contributions to understanding how blockchain technology can revolutionize the gaming industry. First, it provides a comprehensive analysis of blockchain’s security advantages, emphasizing its capacity to reduce online fraud and enhance the protection of digital assets. Second, the paper explores how blockchain enhances player autonomy by establishing secure digital identities and tokenising in-game assets. By enabling players to own, trade, and exchange their assets directly, blockchain fosters a decentralized gaming economy that grants players greater control over their virtual possessions. Finally, the paper identifies emerging trends and potential research avenues in blockchain-enabled gaming, offering valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.},

Its purpose is to enable game industry stakeholders such as game developers, content creators, and regular gamers to create and exchange game assets in a more secure and trusted environment. The security of traditional databases and potential data tampering or dangerous user behavior is improved, as outlined in the paper, by blockchain technology, which is used to record critical operations in a ledger, preserving the identity of the user at all times. From a technical perspective, the main goal is to provide an architecture that is easy to use, flexible, understandable, and has an extensible SDK. Using the framework, game developers and regular users should be able to create and trade assets without third-party providers, and use all related services directly in the game interface itself, without having to switch between applications or pay additional transfer fees to providers. We also encourage the development of games with shared marketplaces and wallets on both the developer and user sides, making it easier to monetize assets and services.},

However, the existing research in this area is fragmented and lacks a comprehensive system overview. This paper aims to bridge the existing research gap on PPSC schemes by systematizing previous studies in this field. The primary focus is on two categories: PPSC schemes based on cryptographic tools like zero-knowledge proofs, as well as schemes based on trusted execution environments. In doing so, we aim to provide a condensed summary of the different approaches taken in constructing PPSC schemes. Additionally, we also offer a comparative analysis of these approaches, highlighting the similarities and differences between them. Furthermore, we shed light on the challenges that developers face when designing and implementing PPSC schemes. Finally, we delve into potential future directions for improving and advancing these schemes, discussing possible avenues for further research and development.},

In this work we present “Eagle”, an efficient UC-secure protocol which efficiently realises a notion of privacy preserving smart contracts where both the amounts of tokens and the auxiliary data given as input to a contract are kept private from all parties but the one providing the input. Prior proposals realizing privacy preserving smart contracts on public, permissionless blockchains generally offer a limited contract functionality or require a trusted third party to manage private inputs and state. We achieve our results through a combination of secure multi-party computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge proofs on Pedersen commitments. Although other approaches leverage MPC in this setting, these incur impractical computational overheads by requiring the computation of cryptographic primitives within MPC. Our solution achieves security without the need of any cryptographic primitives to be computed inside the MPC instance and only require a constant amount of exponentiations per client input.},

	abstract = {Enhancing privacy on smart contract-enabled blockchains has garnered much attention in recent research. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) is one of the most popular approaches, however, they fail to provide full expressiveness and fine-grained privacy. To illustrate this, we underscore an underexplored type of Miner Extractable Value (MEV), called Residual Bids Extractable Value (RBEV). Residual bids highlight the vulnerability where unfulfilled bids inadvertently reveal traders' unmet demands and prospective trading strategies, thus exposing them to exploitation. ZKP-based approaches failed to address RBEV as they cannot provide post-execution privacy without some level of information disclosure. Other MEV mitigations like fair-ordering protocols also failed to address RBEV. We introduce Ratel, an innovative framework bridging a multi-party computation (MPC) prototyping framework (MP-SPDZ) and a smart contract language (Solidity), harmonizing the privacy with full expressiveness of MPC with Solidity 's on-chain programmability. This synergy empowers developers to effortlessly craft privacy-preserving decentralized applications (DApps). We demonstrate Ratel's efficacy through two distinguished decentralized finance (DeFi) applications: a decentralized exchange and a collateral auction, effectively mitigating the potential RBEV issue. Furthermore, Ratel is equipped with a lightweight crash-reset mechanism, enabling the seamless recovery of transiently benign faulty nodes. To prevent the crash-reset mechanism abused by malicious entities and ward off DoS attacks, we incorporate a cost-utility analysis anchored in the Bayesian approach. Our performance evaluation of the applications developed under the Ratel framework underscores their competency in managing real-world peak-time workloads.},

	abstract = {Privacy concerns of smart contracts are a major roadblock preventing their wider adoption. A promising approach to protect private data is hiding it with cryptographic primitives and then enforcing correctness of state updates by Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proofs. Unfortunately, NIZK statements are less expressive than smart contracts, forcing developers to keep some functionality in the contract. This results in scattered logic, split across contract code and NIZK statements, with unclear privacy guarantees. To address these problems, we present the zkay language, which introduces privacy types defining owners of private values. zkay contracts are statically type checked to (i) ensure they are realizable using NIZK proofs and (ii) prevent unintended information leaks. Moreover, the logic of zkay contracts is easy to follow by just ignoring privacy types. To enforce zkay contracts, we automatically transform them into contracts equivalent in terms of privacy and functionality, yet executable on public blockchains. We evaluated our approach on a proof-of-concept implementation generating Solidity contracts and implemented 10 interesting example contracts in zkay. Our results indicate that zkay is practical: On-chain cost for executing the transformed contracts is around 1M gas per transaction ({\textasciitilde}0.50US\$) and off-chain cost is moderate.},

The mass adoption of enterprise blockchains has not yet been achieved because blockchain networks act as isolated islands that cannot connect or exchange assets and/or information. In addition, the invocation of smart contracts is restricted only to on-chain executions because of the lack of connectivity between the blockchains. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive and thorough literature review regarding blockchain interoperability, with special highlight on blockchain Oracles being state-of-the-art. Oracles have shown potential as an emerging technology that has revolutionized the blockchain ecosystem by acting as agents that fetch external information into the blockchain ecosystem. A detailed comparative discussion of different blockchain interoperability techniques is presented, showing the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Being overlooked in the literature, the shortcomings of these techniques in comparison to Oracles are identified, addressing how Oracles have succeeded in overcoming many of these limitations. In addition, the literature lacks a focus on the latest market solutions adopting blockchain Oracles, and only a few studies have considered them in detail. This gap has been addressed through an in-depth assessment of the latest market solutions adopting Oracles in the past few years. Finally, design issues trying to achieve the best practices of Oracles, future directions, and identified research gaps are highlighted.},

However, there is always risk of oracles providing corrupt, malicious, or inaccurate data. In this paper, we analyze and present the notion of trust in the oracles used in blockchain ecosystems.

	abstract = {Blockchain, or distributed ledger, provides a way to build various decentralized systems without relying on any single trusted party. This is especially attractive for smart contracts, that different parties do not need to trust each other to have a contract, and the distributed ledger can guarantee correct execution of the contract. Most existing distributed ledger based smart contract systems process smart contracts in a serial manner, i.e., all users have to run a contract before its result can be accepted by the system. Although this approach is easy to implement and manage, it is not scalable and greatly limits the system's capability of handling a large number of smart contracts. In order to address this problem, we propose a scalable smart contract execution scheme that can run multiple smart contract in parallel to improve throughput of the system. Our scheme relies on two key techniques: a fair contract partition algorithm leveraging integer linear programming to partition a set of smart contracts into multiple subsets, and a random assignment protocol assigning subsets randomly to a subgroup of users. We prove that, our scheme is secure as long as more than 50\% of the computational power is possessed by honest nodes. We then conduct experiments with data from existing smart contract system to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme. The results demonstrate that our approach is scalable and much more efficient than the existing smart contract platform.},

	abstract = {Scalability is a grave challenge for blockchain technology with consequent repercussions on performance. In recent years, scaling Ethereum has been one of the most deliberated and trending subjects in the crypto and blockchain space. This debate particularly intensifies during periods of high network activity, such as the craze of CryptoKitties in 2017, 2020’s DeFi Summer, and 2021’s crypto bull market. Lately, network congestion has intensified significantly due to the rising popularity of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and yield farming. The unparalleled surges in demand during these times, resulted in tremendously high gas fees, making it hard and expensive for commonplace users to pay for their transactions. To overcome these limitations, this paper aims at analysing the available Layer II scalability solutions while highlighting the main differences among the examined frameworks, while focusing on theoretical as well as practical realworld aspects. The first section is an introduction about the scalability issue, the blockchain trilemma and the available layers of solutions. It gives a small overview about Layer1 solutions and the concept of sidechain and then dwells in depth on Layer 2 solutions. Since the Ethereum Layer 2 (L2s) ecosystem has grown tremendously in terms of the number of available systems, system architectures, and their complexity, a deep understanding of these systems is increasingly imperative. So, in the second section, we address the question of what are layer 2 scalability solutions and what do they offer, by doing a comparative study of types of L2s and presenting a tabular summary of the same. Then we analyse the trends and key aspects such as scalability, security, decentralization, privacy, etc. and conclude that rollups are the most effective and adopted solution. With their potential to significantly boost blockchain scalability while preserving transaction privacy and security, they are rightly referred as the Holy Grail of scaling. In the third section of our paper we then answer the questions: What advantages do Rollups offer? And, how have they become the most anticipated and awaited scaling solution of them all? We then present a comparison between Optimistic and Zk Rollup. Through comparative evaluations and discussions of technical challenges and future directions, we elucidate zkRollup's role in shaping the future of decentralized systems and the blockchain technology. In section four, we will do an in-depth breakdown of the implementations of Optimistic and Zk Rollup, by highlighting their potential and analysing the Zero knowledge proofs.},

	abstract = {Blockchain systems have seen much growth in recent years due to the immense potential attributed to the technology behind these systems. However, this popularity has outlined a critical scalability issue that most blockchain systems are now confronted with. With their increasing popularity comes an increasing amount of load on the system. Several scaling solutions that modify either the functioning of the underlying protocol or that build on top of them have already been proposed; however, each of these solutions comes with their advantages and disadvantages. This paper aims to survey the current state-of-the-art of rollups as a scaling solution. We discuss the mode of operation of the different types of rollups, outline state-of-the-art implementations of each type together with their features and limitations. We also conduct a performance analysis comparing these implementations. Finally, we outline avenues for future research around rollups as a scaling solution.},

	abstract = {Blockchain transactions are recorded in a shared and append-only repository that multiple parties verify, validate, and agree upon. While initially used to keep track of digital assets, blockchains now track the ownership and provenance of tangible assets. An inherent challenge in using blockchain for this task involves keeping the status of a tangible asset in the physical world in sync with its non-fungible token on a blockchain. While several blockchains are already being used in this manner, specific implementation details are fragmented. In response, this study examines four stages of tracking tangible assets using a consortium's permissioned blockchain, including: design and governance of a blockchain, asset creation, asset transfer, and asset retirement. Based on this analysis, this study proposes a framework of risk considerations and control objectives to evaluate the extent to which a unique blockchain serves as a reliable transaction repository for tracking the ownership and provenance of tangible assets.},

	abstract = {We study the economic determinants of transaction fees in the Ethereum blockchain. We estimate an empirical model based on queueing theory and analyze the factors determining the “gas price” (transaction cost per unit of service, “gas”). Using block- and transaction-level data from the Ethereum blockchain, we show that changes in service demand significantly affect the gas price—when there is high block utilization, per-unit fees increase on average, with strong nonlinear effect above 90\% utilization. The transaction type is another important factor—larger fraction of regular transactions (direct transfers between users) is associated with higher gas price.},
